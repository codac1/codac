# CODAC Agent 🚀
**AI-Powered Signal Generator for Crypto Infrastructure**

CODAC Agent is designed to automate the discovery of emerging meme coins and tokens by scraping pump.fun using advanced web scraping and AI-driven analysis. This project empowers users to stay ahead in the fast-paced crypto space by generating actionable insights in real-time.

---

## 🔍 Our Approach
CODAC Agent leverages real-time data scraping and engagement metrics to track new coin launches, allowing users to identify trends early. By focusing on user engagement signals and market data, CODAC offers predictive insights into potentially high-performing tokens.

---

## 🚀 Key Innovations
- **AI-Powered Signal Generation** – Advanced algorithms filter and highlight new tokens with high engagement.
- **Web Scraping with Puppeteer** – Automatically scrape pump.fun for the latest meme coin listings.
- **Real-Time Monitoring** – Live updates with WebSockets and analytics dashboards.
- **Transparent Scoring System** – Analyze engagement beyond surface metrics to detect promising assets.
- **Automated Notifications** – Stay informed with automated alerts on trending tokens.

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation
Built with modern technologies for scalability and real-time processing:
- **Node.js** – Backend API server and application logic.
- **Express** – Lightweight and efficient API development.
- **Puppeteer** – Web scraping and automation.
- **Redis** – Caching for faster data retrieval.
- **PostgreSQL** – Reliable data storage for scraped tokens and market data.
- **Prometheus & Grafana** – Monitoring and performance analytics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/username/codac-agent.git
cd codac-agent

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and configure it with the necessary API keys and credentials:
```env
PORT=3000
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
DB_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/codac
```
PORT: The port where the server will run.
REDIS_URL: Redis connection string (for caching).
DB_URL: PostgreSQL database URL (for data storage).

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
npm start
```
or for development with hot reloading:
```bash
npm run dev
```
npm start – Runs the server normally.
npm run dev – Uses nodemon to restart the server automatically when changes are detected.

## 🧪 Running Tests
```bash
npm run test
```
Test cases are located in the /tests directory.
Uses Jest and Supertest for API endpoint testing.

## 🐳 Docker Setup
If you prefer to run the project inside a Docker container:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will spin up the entire project along with Redis and PostgreSQL services as defined in docker-compose.yml.

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics
Grafana dashboards are available at:

arduino
Copy code
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
Prometheus metrics can be accessed at:

arduino
Copy code
```bash
http://localhost:9090
```
These services monitor application health, performance, and API request statistics.

### **Fix Summary:**
- Each code block (`bash` or `env`) **now opens and closes correctly**.
- I wrapped each command in **triple backticks** properly, preventing the text from blending.
- This layout will look clean and professional when rendered on GitHub.

Let me know if this resolves the issue!
